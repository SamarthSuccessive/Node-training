MongoDB
MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database management system that uses a document-oriented database model. It is designed to be flexible, scalable, and easy to use.

Introduction
MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time. This flexibility allows for easier integration of data in certain types of applications.

ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
MongoDB is often used with Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries like Mongoose in Node.js. ORM libraries allow developers to work with MongoDB using familiar programming patterns, making it easier to interact with the database from application code.

Mongoose
Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model application data. Mongoose helps in defining schemas for collections, enforcing data validation, and providing easy access to the database for CRUD operations.

Difference between RDBMS and NoSQL Databases
RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)
RDBMS stores data in tables with rows and columns.
It uses a structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data.
RDBMS is best suited for applications that require complex queries and transactions.
NoSQL Databases
NoSQL databases like MongoDB store data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
They are schema-less or have a flexible schema, allowing for easier data model evolution.
NoSQL databases are often used in applications that require scalability and high-performance, such as real-time web applications.
